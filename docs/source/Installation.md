## Installation for end users

From PyPI:

```sh
pip install bluecast
```

Using a fresh environment with Python 3.9 or higher is recommended. We consciously
do not support Python 3.8 or lower to prevent the usage of outdated Python versions
and issues connected to it.

## Installation for developers

* Clone the repository:
* Create a new conda environment with Python 3.9 or higher
* run `pip install poetry` to install poetry as dependency manager
* run `poetry install` to install all dependencies
*
